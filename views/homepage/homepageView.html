            <ul>
                <li>Exposed the web3 object to your browser (Metamask,Mist,Geth)</li>
                <li>A running ipfs daemon</li>

            <h4>Community does some things differently!</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There are two voting systems: public (viewable by anyone) and private (this data stays client side and never reaches the web)</li>
                <li>Usernames are hidden until you cast a private vote on that specific comment</li>
                <li>Any public action will cost around 1 cent. This includes: posts,comments, setting a username, and casting a public vote</li>
                <li>Posts are sorted by their combined score which is determined by a voting algorithm</li>
                <li>Posts with a combined score of less than 20 will be hidden. This number will likely evolve over time as better voting algorithms are discovered</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>In the event something goes wrong...</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearing local storage can help if data got corrupted</li>
                <li>Hard Refresh the page (ctrl+shift+r)</li>
            </ul>
