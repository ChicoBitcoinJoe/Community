    - Custom themes
    - Custom AutoModerators/Automoderator Market

    - Adopt a standard for LinkDB event data
    

### Funding Goals ###

#### Teir 1: $8400 ####
Teir 1 gives me the minimum amount of money for one year of development. If the goal is not reached I will work for X months where X is the total amount funded divided by $700 (rent+internet+electricity)
    
    
#### Teir 2: $6000 - $12000 ####
Teir 2 funding will be spent towards hiring another developer to help implement my project vision.      
      
#### Teir 3: $0+ ####
Teir 3 funding is flex funds to be used at my discretion for things like
    - Giving extensions, raises, or hiring more developers
    - Funding another year of teir 1 development
    - If money to spare, give myself a raise to cover additional expenses I have (student loans+insurance+food)
